		<p style="color:red"> You could say that dogs are a man's best friend, which would be a very accurate description
		of our furry friends. Dogs come in all shapes and sizes. There are little dogs, medium 
		sized dogs, and big dogs. Not only are they a great life companion, but they can do much 
		more than be there for you to love on them. They are used for sport, such as hunting.  
		</p>
		<p style="color:red">Different dogs have different personalities. Just like every person has differing
		personalities. For example my dog, Duke, is a huge chocolate lab with a wild and crazy 
		personality; however, my friend has a dachshund named Rue, and his personality is
		 much more reserved than Duke's. Dogs that are more playful may be a better fit to use 
		in outdoor activities like hunting or even dog shows. To train dogs for these types of 
		activities can take months, but it is well worth it because your pet will come back much
		 more obedient than he or she was before. </p>
		<p style="color:red">The most rewarding part about having a dog as a pet is the companionship. They are
		 there whenever you need them, and they always approach you with a big, slobbery
		 smile. In good times or even bad times, dogs can be the most comforting part of your 
		day. All of these are reasons why dog, is a man's best friend. </p>
